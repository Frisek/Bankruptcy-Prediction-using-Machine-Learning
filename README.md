# Bankruptcy-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict bankruptcy of companies based on different variables. The dataset used in this project contains information about companies, such as their financial ratios, liquidity, solvency, profitability, and activity. The aim of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict if a company will go bankrupt or not.

The project starts with data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and identify any patterns or trends. After that, various machine learning models are trained and evaluated, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. The models are optimized using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve their performance.

The final model is then used to predict the bankruptcy of new companies based on their financial data. The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project concludes with a discussion of the results and recommendations for future work.

Technologies used: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.

Keywords: Machine Learning, Bankruptcy Prediction, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Cross-validation, Hyperparameter Tuning, Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Performance Metrics.
